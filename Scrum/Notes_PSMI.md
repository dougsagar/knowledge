# Scrum
Scrum is a collaboration framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

### NOTE: Scrum is not a methodology, process, or technique for building products. It is a container framework wrapping around any appropiate process or technique. i.e XP

## Scrum Pillars
* Transparency:
The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts. Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.

* Inspection:
The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events.

* Adaption
If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.                                             

## Scrun Values
* Commitment:
Commitment of every team member to achieve the goals of the Scrum Team.

* Courage:
Courage to work on tough problems. Courage to do the right thing by accepting that the future cannot be predicted and responding to emerging change.

* Focus:
Focus of the team on prioritizing and completing the Sprint work to achieve the goals of the Scrum Team. Focus helps to avoid doing other things not related to the Sprint Goal.

* Openness:
Openness of the Scrum Team and its stakeholders in expressing and facing the facts and truths about all the work and challenges with performing the work, thereby increasing transparency. Openness to collaborate with others with the highest amount of transparency.

* Respect:
Respect each other as capable and independent people so that it can provide a trustworthy environment to learn and share.

## Empiricism:

## Scrum Structure:
**Roles**
1. Product Owner
2. Scrum Master
3. Development Team

### What is their responsability?
**Scrum Master**: Guardian Scrum Implementation. Help the teams and enact it by spirit. Eliminate Scrumbuts.

**Product Owner**: Build and maintain a backlog of valuable product and help teams understand and deliver high value.

**Development Team**: Understand Scrum and selft-organize to focus and deliver the Sprint goal. Improve the way of working sprint by sprint.

### What do they manage?
**Scrum Master**: Not people. Manage the Scrum implementation.

**Product Owner**: Not people. Manage the Product Backlog.

**Development Team**: Not people. Manage the Sprint backlog and the development work.

### Who do they work with?
**Scrum Master**: One or more Scrum Teams.

**Product Owner**: One or more Scrum Teams. 

**Development Team**: One Scrum Team dedicated.

### Is it a dedicated role?
**Scrum Master**: They can be dedicated. They can also be a Development Team member.

**Product Owner**: They can be dedicated. They can also be a Development Team member.

**Development Team**: They can also play another Scrum role.

### Who do they report?
**Scrum Master | Product Owner | Development Team**:

They self organize how to do their work. With respect to HR aspects, they report to some appropriate authority in the organization.

2. Events:
    1. Sprint:
    It is the heart of Scrum. It is like a mini-project that contains the other four events.

    2. Sprint Planning:
    This is the first event of the Sprint. A small amount of work is chosen and a plan of how to deliver that work is put together. (time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.)

    3. Daily Scrum:
    The short and quick daily recurring event within the Sprint where the team members synchronize their progress with each other and confirm the next 24-hour plan. (15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.)

    4. Sprint Review:
    the team makes their progress visible to the stakeholders. Both the team and stakeholders collaborate to adjust their next steps. (a four-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.)

    5. Sprint Retrospective:
    This is an inspection and adaptation opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect their way of working and identify potential improvements. how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, processes, and tools. It identifies and orders the major items that went well and potential improvements. (three-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.) Note: The Retrospective is about improving the way the product is built. It is not only the improvements of how Scrum is implemented by the team, but also the engineering practices like coding, testing, integration, deployment, etc. During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team plans ways to increase product quality by adapting the definition of “Done” as appropriate.

### Product Backlog Refinement (Is is not consider as official event in Scrum)
**Purpose**: The Product Owner and Development Team continuously refine the Product Backlog Items. The items are refined until they are transparent enough for the Development Team to estimate and confirm that they can be “Done” within a Sprint. When a Product Backlog Item reaches this level of transparency, it is also known as “Ready.” The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. 

The definition of "Ready” is a shared understanding by the Product Owner and the Development Team regarding how much clarity the Product Backlog Items should have before they are introduced at Sprint Planning. A Scrum Team should not wait until Sprint Planning to refine the items in a “just in time” manner. It is good practice to have a sufficient number of items in a “Ready” state for at least one or two upcoming Sprints. When: Backlog Refinement starts before the first Sprint and goes on throughout all Sprints. The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done. However, Product Backlog Items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion. 

**Timeline:** This is probably the only activity in the Sprint where the Development Team performs work outside the current Sprint Goal. Because it is important to ensure that there will always be some “Ready” items that can be selected for the next Sprint. But care should be taken to optimize the time which the team spends on this act. Though this is not a time-boxed activity, **Refinement usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team.

**What is achieved:** Product Backlog Items are decomposed by analyzing their intent. Each item is added with a description, order, estimate, and value. Higher-order Product Backlog Items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower-order ones. More precise estimates are made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the lower the order, the less detail.

3. Artifacts:
    * Increment:
    It is a body of inspectable and usable outcome, is the mark of the real progress, and it provides information for required stakeholders about the progress so far.

    * Done (it doesn't count as artifact for the exam or new Scrum Guide):
    It defines set of conditions that must be met in order to accept the team’s Sprint outcome as a product Increment. In other words, a product Increment is a body of inspectable, "Done" work.

    * Product Backlog:
    Backlog is the product definition in terms of ordered product features. It is never frozen (closed for changes) and is a continuously evolving artifact because the Scrum Team and Product Owner in particular are always looking for changes and opportunities to maximize the value of the product. Using the ordered features, one can understand what the team will work on in the future.

    * Sprint Backlog:
    It is temporary aritfact created in each srpint. It contains the subset of the Product Backlog Items chosen to be delivered in the upcoming Sprint, the plan of how to deliver them, and at least one improvement required in the team’s way of working. It is the plan maintained by the team about what tasks should be performed within the current Sprint.

    The outcome is a Sprint Backlog that contains Product Backlog Items, a plan for delivering them, and one or more team improvement items. In addition to the Sprint Backlog, the team also creates a Sprint Goal. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

**NOTE**:
* Cross-functional means having all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not on the team. 

• Self-organizing means empowerment to choose how best to accomplish their work rather than being directed by others outside the team.

* Parameters like timelines and budget are reviewed in the Sprint Review. Work standards like definition of "Done" are reviewed in the Sprint Retrospective.

### What happens in Sprint Planning?
First Phase - the team begins **Topic One** by selecting the Product Backlog Items and setting the Sprint Goal. The PO discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog Items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal.

The Product Owner will introduce the Product Backlog Items that are “ready” - already refined to a state agreed upon by the Development Team and Product Owner. Just in time refinement will lead to poorly understood product needs and result in poor Sprint Planning. The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the Development Team. The selected items are moved to the Sprint Backlog.

After the Development Team forecasts the Product Backlog Items it will deliver in the Sprint, the Scrum Team crafts a Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog. The Sprint Goal provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. 

The Sprint Goal is a tool for team coherence. The selected Product Backlog Items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal. The coherence between the Product Backlog Items is made transparent by the Sprint Goal. This is important because it provides an opportunity for team members to work together and offers some flexibility of adjusting the Product Backlog Items when required. Lack of coherence may lead the team to working on separate initiatives. So, the Sprint Goal is a tool to verify and create this coherence. 

As the Development Team works, it keeps the Sprint Goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements the functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than what the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.

**Topic Two** - The Development Team decides how it will build this functionality into a “Done” product Increment during the Sprint. The Development Team usually starts by designing the system and then identifies the work needed to convert the selected Product Backlog Items into a working product Increment. Based on the estimate of the work, the Development Team plans enough work to match the available capacity. If the Development Team determines it has too much or too little work, it may renegotiate the selected Product Backlog Items with the Product Owner. 

The Product Backlog Items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog. By the end of Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment.

## Sprint Review notes:
### How does the Product Owner monitor the progress towards the goal? 
Various projective practices, based on trending, have been used to forecast progress, like Burn-down Charts, Burn-up Charts, or Cumulative Flow Diagrams. The Product Owner may use them to track progress and forecast completion. These are not artifacts mandated by Scrum, but the Scrum Team may use them if the tools add value.
 
**A Product Burn-down Chart** shows the estimated total amount of work (Product Backlog Items) remaining and its evolution over time.

**A Product Burn-up Chart** shows the amount of Product Backlog Items cumulatively “Done” so far and its evolution over time.

The difference between the Product Burn-down Chart and the Sprint Burn-down Chart is for both the Product Burn-down Chart and the Sprint Burn-down Chart, the y-axis always represents the work remaining. Note that the "number of work items (tasks)" is different from the "amount of work."

## Summary
* A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment. The Product Backlog is adapted if needed.
* This is a four-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints.
* This is an informal meeting to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.
* The Development Team demonstrates the work that is “Done.”
* They review the timeline, budget, and potential capabilities and marketplace for the next Increment.

## Scrum Retrospective notes:
**What is achieved in the Sprint Retrospective?** 
The Scrum Team is a self-organized team that continuously improves its way of working Sprint to Sprint without any external push. Although improvements may be implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspecting the Scrum Team itself.

This is a three-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month

**What happens in the Sprint Retrospective?**
The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, processes, and tools. It identifies and orders the major items that went well and potential improvements.

**The Retrospective is about improving the way the product is built. It is not only the improvements of how Scrum is implemented by the team, but also the engineering practices like coding, testing, integration, deployment, etc.**


## 4. Rules
### 4.1 Product Owner
* They can be full or part time for a Scrum Team. They are usually a Product Owner for more than one Scrum Team in parallel.
* It can delegate one or more responsabilities to others in the Team, but they are still accountable for the product value
* It is mandatory to participate in all events except the Daily Scrum.
* No one can change the Product Backlog other than PO. But the rest of team can recommend items that could be added to the Product Backlog.
* No ona can cancel the Sprint other than PO. But the rest of the Team can influence the PO to make the decision.
* If stakeholder needs to communicate anything to the Team, they should direct such communications through the PO.

### 4.2 Scrum Master
* The SM need not be a technical member of the Develpment Team. They can be full-time or par-time for a Scrum Team. They are usually a SM for more than one Scrum Team in parallel.
* It is mandatory to participate in all events except the Daily Scrum.

### 4.3 Development Team
* The DT as whole and not individual is accountable for Sprint progress.
* They are responsable only for items realted with Sprint Goal and Srpint Backlog.
* During Sprint Planning, no one other than the Development Team makes decisions about how many Backlog iItem they will include in a Sprint.
* The DT completely owns the Srpint Backlog. Nobody can change the Sprint Backlog other than DT. the PO can influence the changes only with tge consent of the DT.
* It is mandatory to participate in all Scrum events and the act of Backlog Refinement.
* There can be multiple Development Teams in paralle. If all of them work on the same product, there should **ONLY ONE** common Product Backlog and a mutually defined definition of "Done". A mutually defined definition of "Done" enables their combined work outcome to be potentially releasable and useable. since there isonly one Product Backlog, there should only be one PO

## Controls For Scrum

1. All Scrum events are time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum duration.

2. Inspections. Other than the Sprint itself, which is a container for all other events, each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt.

3. The Scrum Master. He/She must work with the Product Owner, Development Team, and other involved parties to understand if the artifacts are completely transparent and must champion to increase the transparency of the artifacts by continuous learning, convincing, and bringing change.

4. “Standard” like the definition of “Done.” Any one product or system should have a definition of “Done” that is standard for any work done on it. If the definition of "Done" for an Increment is part of the conventions, standards or guidelines of the development organization.
