## 4. Rules
### 4.1 Product Owner
* They can be full or part time for a Scrum Team. They are usually a Product Owner for more than one Scrum Team in parallel.
* It can delegate one or more responsabilities to others in the Team, but they are still accountable for the product value
* It is mandatory to participate in all events except the Daily Scrum.
* No one can change the Product Backlog other than PO. But the rest of team can recommend items that could be added to the Product Backlog.
* No ona can cancel the Sprint other than PO. But the rest of the Team can influence the PO to make the decision.
* If stakeholder needs to communicate anythin to the Team, they should direct such communications through the PO.

### 4.2 Scrum Master
* The SM need not be a technical member of the Develpment Team. They can be full-time or par-time for a Scrum Team. They are usually a SM for more than one Scrum Team in parallel.
* It is mandatory to participate in all events except the Daily Scrum.

### 4.3 Development Team
* The DT as whole and not individual is accountable for Sprint progress.
* They are responsable only for items realted with Sprint Goal and Srpint Backlog.
* During Sprint Planning, no one other than the Development Team makes decisions about how many Backlog iItem they will include in a Sprint.
* The DT completely owns the Srpint Backlog. Nobody can change the Sprint Backlog other than DT. the PO can influence the changes only with tge consent of the DT.
* It is mandatory to participate in all Scrum events and the act of BAcklog Refinement.
* There can be multiple Development Teams in paralle. If all of them work on the same product, there should **ONLY ONE** common Product BAcklog and a mutually defined definition of "Done". A mutually defined definition of "Done" enables their combined work outcome to be potentially releasable and useable. since there isonly one Product BAcklog, there should only be one PO
